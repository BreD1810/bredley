I have completed a number of projects with a variety of languages. Some of the best ones can be found on my [Github](http://github.com/BreD1810), but here are some of my favourites!

## Pexip Internship Challenge
In my second year of university, I received an internship offer with a startup called [Pexip](https://www.pexip.com/). As part of the process, I was given a programming task where I had to find a word within a 10000x10000 character grid. Although I decided to join the American Express internship scheme instead, I found this challenge really interesting. I trialled a few different solutions and experimented with different tools, such as continuous integration and unit testing.

Check out the code and discussion [here](https://github.com/BreD1810/Pexip).

## Fortuna 2048
To demonstrate our learning of lower level hardware programming for the 'Computer Systems 2' module, I implemented the mobile game '[2048](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androbaby.game2048&hl=en)' with a friend. The module provided us with a custom microcontroller board made in-house called 'La Fortuna'. This device has a small LCD display and a rotary dial for input. We implemented the game in C, including high-score storage on the EEPROM so that it was not lost when the device was turned off. 

Check out the code [here](https://github.com/BreD1810/fortuna-2048).

## Connect 4
With the hope of learning the features of C#, I set out to make the classic game 'Connect 4' with a few friends from university. This began as a simple console application. However, we are hoping to expand the project to include a UWP app, and also a mobile app built with [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin).

Check out the code [here](https://github.com/GUIs-Are-For-the-Weak/Connect4).

## Haskell Programming
As part of the Programming 3 module in the second year of my university course, I have completed several tasks using the Haskell programming language, which uses a functional paradigm. Sadly I cannot share code for coursework tasks, but I have also made a interpreter for my own programming language using Haskell alongside the [Alex](https://www.haskell.org/alex/) and [Happy](https://www.haskell.org/happy/) libraries!
