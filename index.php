    I am a first year Computer Science Student at the University of Southampton.
    Currently I am working on a variety of projects in multiple languages such as Java, C# and Python.
    In my free time, I enjoy competitive E-Sports, most notably reaching the second highest division in Team Fortress 2's European league. I also enjoy fishing, target shooting and cycling.
